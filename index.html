            I really hope you like it, I spent a few days trying to figure out how to make this work. I think you and I know why am I doing this, but we'll leave that for later shouldn't we?
        </h5>
        <h5>Love, just know that I couldn't be happier to show you how much you mean to me. I might look serious or quiet when I'm near you, but I'm the happiest when I'm around you. I'm sorry if I ever
            made you doubt about the love I had for you, but that's why I made this! For you, and only you.

        <p> time flies by very quickly I can't believe that it has been quite a while since I've had the pleasure of knowing more about you and actually fell in love with you WOAH!</p>
        <p>Happy Valentine's my love, I hope that you can enjoy this special day and enjoy as well the gifts I gave you, I really wanted to try and make your day happier with the flowers I gave you; you deserve them. Babe I will never get tired of saying how much I love you and appreciate you, especially since the day you started being part of my life I can assure you that my days have been so much better and happier; the first thought that came to my mind when I realized valentines was near was ‚Äúyou‚Äù and right away I came up with many ideas and in the end, this is what I thought it was the best way of showing you how much I want you in my life.</p>
